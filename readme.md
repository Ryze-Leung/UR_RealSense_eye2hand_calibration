This repository contains scripts for connecting and calibrating a RealSense D435i camera and a UR robot using RTDE.

---

## Prerequisites

Before running the scripts, make sure to install the required dependencies.

### Dependencies

Install the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`
- `socket`
- `struct`
- `matplotlib`
